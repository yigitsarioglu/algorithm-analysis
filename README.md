## First Project
[First Project](https://github.com/yigitsarioglu/algorithm-analysis/tree/main/project1)

It analyzes the algorithm and finds the time complexity of the algorithm. It also draws the graphics of the execution times. This project compare the best case, average case and worst case running times of an given algorithm.

## Second Project
[Second Project](https://github.com/yigitsarioglu/algorithm-analysis/tree/main/project2)

MPI programming project (parallel programming) which coded with python.

## Third Project
[Third Project](https://github.com/yigitsarioglu/algorithm-analysis/tree/main/project3)

Implementation of Different Versions of Quicksort Algorithm (four different versions)
